I started to generate several asymmetrical patterns based on clay cracks images and to use them to explore kinect systems by building digital models of these “perforated surfaces” and testing what the different types of movement of them behind each other can result in terms of shadows, textures and openings.
The fact of using asymmetrical patterns instead of symmetrical ones, can originate some interesting, functional uses of the perforated dynamic screens on architecture.

Imagine the “tessellate” idea applied to a whole building floor, the movement on a symmetrical pattern would make all this floor have the same quantity of light getting inside, using an asymmetrical pattern instead, part of the floor could have a lot of light getting in while the other part have very few.

An asymmetrical kinetic surface, which could respond to environmental changes, besides looking visually interesting, can make a floor of a building have more than one function. With different needs of light during the day and different spaces while having the same pattern on the facade, the same would happen to a building that receives natural light in different sides during the day.

After making some shadows testing with the digital model I realize that using the clay cracks pattern as the “closed part” of a perforated panel was resulting in what I call “tree asymmetrical effect” which is producing shadows which look like the shadows of a tree in a winter sunny day. Moreover, using multiple of these panels behind each other making different movements made me realize that even though it originate interesting effects these effects are also too confusing, generating some kind of visual pollution, and the curved lines with sharp edges could make people feel like in an obscure, somber place, which is the opposite of what I wanted.
