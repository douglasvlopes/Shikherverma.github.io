  Carbon3D developed a new technology that can be 25 to 100 times faster than existing 3D printers, in my opinion it can be considered a evolution of regular 3D printers because it offers a game changing speed and choice of materials:
   .1 Rigid Polyurethane - Tough + abrasion resistant, stiff
   .2 Flexible Polyurethane - Tough, impact + abrasion resistant, moderate stiffness
   .3 Elastometric Polyurethane - Highly elastic, resilient
   .4 Cyanate Ester - High temperature resistence, strength + stiffness
   .5 Prototyping - General purpose
  And all of this is possible thanks to a technology called Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP)

 “Current 3D printing technology has failed to deliver on its promise to revolutionize manufacturing,” said Carbon3D co-founder and CEO Joseph DeSimone. 
 
 ##How it works?
 All start with plastic resin called the “goo.” It solidifies when exposed to UV light. A projector projects cross sections of the print with UV light under the pool of resine. The light solidifies layer after layer of the print. It basically works by balancing UV light and oxygen, it's a photo polymerization process.

The technology is being compared to the scene in 1991’s ‘Terminator 2: Judgement Day’. Ford announced to be interested in this technology, and was testing the Carbon3D fast 3D printer. 3-D printing is slow; it’s really just “2-D printing over and over,” says chemist and material scientist Joseph DeSimone, click on the image below to see he at TED2015 unveiling this new techinique.

  I personally find this new technology very interesting for architects and designers because of its eficiency and the freedom provided. You can bring any prototype to reality really fast, it means you can experiment diferent shapes and diferent materials much more than you would in a usual 3D Printer.
