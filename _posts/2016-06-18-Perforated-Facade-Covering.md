### Panels, Mashrabiya, Cobogós
  
The question was “How can I transform some clay crack pattern in something dynamic that could be used in an efficient way on a building façade?” That is when I did a little research and came up with three most traditional perforated facade covering technics: Panels, Mashrabiya (projecting oriel window enclosed with carved wood “latticework”), and Cobogós (usually made of concrete, completing walls and walls to allow more ventilation and light inside a property).
