Therefore, I realized that something these covering technics have in common is that they are static, so they never change related to climate, luminosity or the use of the space, so I decided to get inspired by them to create a dynamic version of it.

These perforated screens are very beautiful but they also have very important functions for example one of the major purposes of the Mashrabiya is privacy, an essential aspect of Arabic culture and one of the functions of cobogós is soften the heat of the Brazilian tropical climate by improving the ventilation.

  ### Mashrabiya
  
I also found some references of dynamic use of these façade coverings:  l’Institut du Monde Arabe by Jean Nouvel is a good example of repeatedly using a kind of mechanical iris to create a facade that could open and close according to the weather based on traditional Arabic mashrabiya. Circles, squares, and octagonal shapes move, opening or closing in a fluid motion according to the exterior light so the interior spaces and the exterior appearance change at the same time.
