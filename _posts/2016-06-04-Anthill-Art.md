 Anthil Art is an intricate (and exact) replica of the interior of an ant hill. It is made by pouring molten aluminum into a fire ant colony. It is then allowed to cool, carefully excavated as a lump and the sand and dirt is hosed off.

The cast is displayed upside down from its natural orientation.The aluminum used is 99.8% pure but probably impurities are introduced during the melting and pouring process.
