"Responsive building facades is an emerging field in architectural research and design. Recent advancements in sensory and motion-control technologies enable building envelopes to adapt their forms to real-time environmental conditions, solar exposure or user driven data sets. Controlled daylight conditions affect people's moods, work efficiency, and also help to save energy. With an increasing demand for 'smart' living and working environments, our project is focusing on a daylight responsive facade system that could be applied to various building typologies.
 
Our "blooming" pattern originates from the folding logic of origami. It changes shape from a triangle to a hexagon shaped unit to maximize the difference between extended and the folded state. Our unit is dynamically oscillating between extended and porous states to compensate for daylight and weather conditions. We have been focusing on mapping planar and cylindrical building geometries with our kinetic system as second skin applied on standard glass curtain facades."
