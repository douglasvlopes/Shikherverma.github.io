### Using clay cracks to create structures

  * Check previous work
  * Experiment different types of clay
  * Test different ways to dry it and make it crack to create interesting patterns
  * Genarate 3D models based on these patterns
  * Build panels prototypes and test light effects on it
  * Make sure it can be used on a facade

 Perforated panelling is also an eco-friendly cladding solution, with a variety of sunshade and screening systems that maximize daylight, deflect heat and save energy.
