### Al Bahr Towers, by Aedas Architects, 2012, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates

Clad with a unique dynamic shading system meant to reduce the buildings’ solar gain by 50%, Aedas’ Al Bahr Towers manage to test the limits of responsive design. The façade features elements inspired by the traditional Islamic lattice shading system, Mashrabiya, which is completely computerized to adjust to changing weather conditions.

### Kiefer Technic Showroom, 2007, Steiermark, Austria

 Ernst Giselbrecht + Partner designed the Kiefer Technic Showroom as an office building and exhibition space with a façade that optimizes the building’s internal climate. The envelope is made from several layers — aluminum posts and transoms encased with an EIFS-façade in white plaster. Perforated aluminum panels are electronically operated and transform the building appearance from a solid monolithic volume to a playful combination of transparent and closed surfaces.
